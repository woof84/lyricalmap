The late 80s and 90s were a tumultuous period of uneven economic development. Racial inequalities affected minorities due to spending cuts on welfare and relief services. The result: an increase in poverty, especially in Los Angeles, where minorities were disproportionately affected by these economic reforms which failed to consider the greater implications on the already-deprived. With little remedy for their pain, it was not uncommon for the poor and disadvantaged to turn to drugs as well as crime. 

Police brutality grew from racism and misperceptions of minorities as criminals, upon whom the police misdirected their violence, as exacerbated by the various policies in place. One such policy was the Anti-drug Abuse Act passed on October 27, 1986, where a drug sentence over crack cocaine was significantly worse than one for powdered cocaine, despite the two having the same effect on people's health (Equal Justice Initiative, n.d.). Since crack cocaine was cheaper than powdered ones, minorities (most specifically Blacks) were more affected by the law than whites, who were relatively more affluent. The act would later lead to an increase in numbers of Blacks admitted to jail for drugs while there was little change in percentage for White citizens (ACLU, 2006). At the same time, this resulted in worsening perceptions of Blacks as drug abusers, which played a factor in police brutality in Los Angeles. With rising concern over the use of violence amongst police departments, police brutality was thus brought to the forefront in Los Angeles County through various media outlets, such as the LA Youth Newspaper. The LA Youth Newspaper, a censorship free press outlet created for young people, encouraged teenagers to work on their critical thinking, writing and civic education skills through coverage of controversial topics. By 2002, LA Youth had become the largest independent teen newspaper in the United States, reflecting the extent of its outreach . Despite its increasing popularity, the LA Youth stopped running in January of 2013 (LA Youth, n.d.).

In June 1990, an article in the LA Youth Newspaper detailed the tension between Black community members and white police officers. LA Youth writers interviewed young civilians about LAPD violence they had witnessed. Personal accounts of those interviewed showed how excessive force was used consistently during this time period, and illustrated the various perspectives of the parties involved on police brutality in Los Angeles. For example, this article highlights a peaceful protest against police brutality in a Pacific Palisades park. During the protest, three men held signs that openly ridiculed the police department for their racial discrimination and profiling. The article concluded by outlining various ways that members of the community could be involved in stopping police misconduct from preparation for talking with the police to knowing one’s rights.

The article brought to attention youth awareness of police brutality in Los Angeles. Racial profiling was especially an area of key concern in Los Angeles, where minorities were unfairly treated, often for crimes they did not commit. The 1992 Rodney King Riots, which took place in Los Angeles, demonstrated the need for reform. One can never forget the uproar over this infamous case of police brutality as it shook the entire nation and became a symbol of civil rights violation and change (CNN, 2012). In remembrance of the troubles, the tragedies and the triumphs that shaped Los Angeles today, it is thus important to document these events, and the crucial need to uphold civil liberties, indiscriminate of race.
